@title{Texts}

The course will rely on a set of course notes and one text book, but
PhD students should learn to read texts on their own in case they must
work on something not quite familiar but in their areaâ€”that's the
essence of a PhD program. Hence the list includes two recommended,
introductory text books.

These two undergraduate texts present the same topics from a hands-on
perspective. They teach you how to construct interpreters, essential
interpretation techniques, and a few applications of these techniques
to domains other than programming languages. Many of you have covered
this material in undergraduate courses. This course takes a look at
this material from a research-oriented perspective.

and Programming Languages}}.  MIT Press 2002.}

This graduate text covers type systems, only one of many topics
covered in this class, in much greater detail than time allows us.

This graduate text covers many of the same topics as this class
although with less of an emphasis on the interaction between semantics
and analysis.  It may prove to be a valuable reference @emph{after}
completing this course.
